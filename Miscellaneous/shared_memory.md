# Shared memory

  In computer hardware, shared memory refers to block of random access memory(RAM) that can
be accessed by several different CPUs in a multiprocessor computer system.

  Shared memory systems may use:
- uniform memory access(UMA): all processors share the physical memory uniformly;
- non-uniform memory access(NUMA): memory access time depends on the memory location relative
to a processor;
- cache-only memory architecture(COMA): the local memories for the processors at each node
is used as cache instead of as actual main memory.
