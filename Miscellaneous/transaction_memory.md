# Transaction Memory
  **Transaction Memory** attempts to simplify concurrent programming by allowing a group of *load*
& *store* instructions to execute in an **atomic** way.
  It is a **concurrency control** mechanism analogous to *database transaction* for controlling
access to shared memory in concurrent programming.
