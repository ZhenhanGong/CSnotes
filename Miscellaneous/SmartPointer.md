# Smart Pointer
  In computer science, a **smart pointer** is an abstract data type that simulate a pointer while
providing added features, such as **automatic memory management** or **bounds checking**.<br><br>

  Pointer misuse can be a major source of bugs. Smart pointer prevent most situations of memory
leaks by making the **memory deallocation** automatic.<br><br>

## C++ Smart Pointer
  In C++, **smart pointer** is implemented as a template class that mimics, by means of operator
overloading, the behaviors of a traditional **raw pointer**, (e.g. dereferencing, assignment) while
providing additional memory management features.<br><br>

## Motivation
  With raw pointer, the programmer need to explicitly delete memory, but it may not goes well.
<br>
```
MyObject* ptr = new MyObject();
ptr->DoSomething();
delete ptr;
// Wait, what if DoSomething() raise an exception ...?
```

  With **Smart Pointer**, we can avoid this.<br>
```
{
  SmartPointer<MyObject> ptr(new MyObject());
  ptr->DoSomething();
} // out of scope, memory freed, even if exception is raised.
```

## Feature
  **Smart pointer** can facilitate **intentional programming** by expressing, in the type, how the
memory of the referent will be managed.<br><br>

  For example, if a C++ function returns a pointer, there is no way to know whether the caller
should **delete** the memory of the referent when the caller is finished with the information.
<br><br>

    `SomeType* AmbiguousFunction()`

  Traditionally, **naming conventions** have been used to resolve the ambiguity, which is an 
error-prone, labor-intensive approach.<br><br>

  C++ 11 introduced a way to ensure correct memory management in this case by declaring the
function to return a *unique_ptr*.<br><br>

    `std::unique_ptr<SomeType> ObviousFunction()` 

  The declaration of the function return type as *unique_ptr* makes sure that:
1. if caller capture the return value, it has exclusive ownership of the memory.
2. if caller don't capture the return value, the resource is freed.
<br><br>

## unique_ptr
  C++ 11 introduces *std::unique_ptr* defined in the header <memory>.<br><br>

  A *unique_ptr* is a container for a raw pointer, which the *unique_ptr* is said to own. A
*unique_ptr* explicitly prevent copying of its contained pointer, but the std::move function can
be used to transfer ownership of the contained pointer to another *unique_ptr*.<br>
```
std::unique_ptr<int> p1(new int(5));
std::unique_ptr<int> p2 = p1; // Compile Error
std::unique_ptr<int> p3 = std::move(p1); // Transfer ownership. p3 owns the memory, p1 is nullptr.

p3.reset(); // Deletes the memory.
p1.reset(); // Does nothing.
```

### unique_ptr tips
  *std::unique_ptr* are useful when you want to tie the lifetime of an object to a particular block
or if you embedded it as member data inside another object, the lifetime of that other object.
<br><br>

## shared_ptr & weak_ptr
  C++ 11 introduces *std::shared_ptr* and *std::weak_ptr*, defined in the header <memory>.<br><br>

  A *shared_ptr* is a container for a raw pointer. It maintains **reference counting** ownership of
its contained pointer in cooperation with all copies of the *shared_ptr*. An object referenced
by the contained raw pointer will be destroyed when all copies have been destroyed.<br>
```
std::shared_ptr<int> p0(new int(5)); // valid, allocate 1 integer & init to 5
std::shared_ptr<int[]> p1(new int[5]); // valid, allocate 5 integers.
std::shared_ptr<int[]> p2 = p1; // Both now own the memory.

p1.reset(); // Memory still exist, due to p2.
p2.reset(); // Delete the memory, since no one owns it.
```
  A *weak_ptr* is a container for a raw pointer. It is created as a copy of a *shared_ptr*. The
existence or destruction of *weak_ptr* copies of a *shared_ptr* have no effect on the *shared_ptr*
or its other copies. After a *shared_ptr* have been destroyed, all *weak_ptr* copies becomes 
**empty**.<br>
```
std::shared_ptr<int> p1 = std::make_shared<int>(5);
std::weak_ptr<int> wp1 {p1}; // p1 owns the memory.

{
  std::shared_ptr<int> p2 = wp1.lock(); // Now p1 and p2 own the memory.
  if (p2) { // p2 is init from a weak pointer, so you have to check if it exist
    DoSomethingWith(p2);
  }
} // p2 is destroyed, Memory is owned by p1.

p1.reset(); // Delete the memory.

std::shared_ptr<int> p3 = wp1.lock(); // Memory is gone, so we get an empty shared_ptr
if (p3) { // code will not execute
  ActionThatNeedALivePointer(p3);
}
```

## shared_ptr & cicular reference
  There is one drawback to **reference counting pointers** -- the possibility of creating
**circular reference**.<br>
```
struct Owner {
  std::shared_ptr<Owner> other;
};

std::shared_ptr<Owner> p1 (new Owner());
std::shared_ptr<Owner> p2 (new Owner());
p1->other = p2; // p1 reference p2
p2->other = p1; // p2 reference p1
// Oops, the reference count of p1 and p2 never goes to 0!
```
  To work around this problem, *weak_ptr*(uncounted reference) can be used.<br><br>

## detailed example
  *unique_ptr* example:<br>
```
// C++ program to illustrate the use of unique_ptr 
#include <iostream> 
#include <memory> 
using namespace std; 

class A { 
public: 
	void show() 
	{ 
		cout << "A::show()" << endl; 
	} 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	unique_ptr<A> p1(new A); 
	p1->show(); 

	// returns the memory address of p1 
	cout << p1.get() << endl; 

	// transfers ownership to p2 
	unique_ptr<A> p2 = move(p1); 
	p2->show(); 
	cout << p1.get() << endl; 
	cout << p2.get() << endl; 

	// transfers ownership to p3 
	unique_ptr<A> p3 = move(p2); 
	p3->show(); 
	cout << p1.get() << endl; 
	cout << p2.get() << endl; 
	cout << p3.get() << endl; 

	return 0; 
} 
```
  output:<br>
```
A::show()
0x1c4ac20
A::show()
0          // NULL
0x1c4ac20
A::show()
0          // NULL
0          // NULL
0x1c4ac20
```
<br>

  *shared_ptr* example:<br>
```
// C++ program to demonstrate shared_ptr 
#include <iostream> 
#include <memory> 
using namespace std; 

class A { 
public: 
	void show() 
	{ 
		cout << "A::show()" << endl; 
	} 
}; 

int main() 
{ 
	shared_ptr<A> p1(new A); 
	cout << p1.get() << endl; 
	p1->show(); 
	shared_ptr<A> p2(p1); 
	p2->show(); 
	cout << p1.get() << endl; 
	cout << p2.get() << endl; 

	// Returns the number of shared_ptr objects 
	// referring to the same managed object. 
	cout << p1.use_count() << endl; 
	cout << p2.use_count() << endl; 

	// Relinquishes ownership of p1 on the object 
	// and pointer becomes NULL 
	p1.reset(); 
	cout << p1.get() << endl; 
	cout << p2.use_count() << endl; 
	cout << p2.get() << endl; 

	return 0; 
} 
```
  output:<br>
```
0x1c41c20
A::show()
A::show()
0x1c41c20
0x1c41c20
2
2
0          // NULL
1
0x1c41c20
```

## initialization
```
Person * p = new Person(5);
Person * p_arr = new Person[100];

std::unique_ptr<Person> p1(new Person(5)); //  init Person to 5
std::unique_ptr<Person[]> p2(new Person[100]); // declare arr of Person[100]

auto p3 = std::make_unique<Person>(5); //  init Person to 5
auto p4 = std::make_unique<Person[]>(100); // declare arr of Person[100]
```

## Function that Return Array (4 ways)
### Classic C++
```
int * foo();
```
Cons: require knowledge of array size, caller shall can delete[].<br>
Pros: no copy is done.<br>

### vector<int>
```
vector<int> foo();
```
Cons: copy all elements.<br>
Pros: vector has a size(), no need to call delete.<br>

### unique_ptr<int[]>
```
unique<int[]> foo();
```
Cons: require knowledge of array size.<br>
Pros: no need to call delete, no copy is done.<br>
